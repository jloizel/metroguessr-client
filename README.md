This project is a metro map memory game where the user needs to enter all the metro stations of the selecited city's metro system. Thew aim is to then release the London, Paris versions and maybe more!



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Instructions

To change timer change the first number in initialTime in timer3.tsx
It may be that I commented some stuff out on page.tsx while I fix the design. So make sure the  <Box> isn't commented out but the <Game> at the end is. This is for testing purposes

Open Server folder in terminal
Run these commands:
npm i
npm install -g nodemon
npm install -g ts-node
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
nodemon

Open Client folder in server
npm run dev
