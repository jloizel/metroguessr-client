<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üìù About The Project

This is my first fully-developed web game and a significant milestone in my coding journey. Inspired by the game GeoGuessr, metroguessr challenges players to guess metro stations based on their location and the lines they serve, providing an entertaining and educational experience. 

I developed this project to push myself beyond tutorials and online courses, learning how to apply React and other modern web technologies in a real-world context. Throughout the development process, I faced a variety of technical challenges, including optimizing the game for performance, managing complex geolocation data, and ensuring scalability as the game grew to over 10,000 users.

Completing this project not only enhanced my skills in React and TypeScript but also deepened my understanding of full-stack development, problem-solving, and deployment in a production environment. It was especially gratifying to see it featured in various media outlets like *Time Out Paris* and *Le Bonbon*.
